My Project
This is the README of the Advent of Code 2024

To allow building only a specific day in your Advent of Code project, you can modify the setup to use CMake's **options** and **conditional building**. This way, you can specify which day to build during configuration.

---

1. **Build a Specific Day**  
   When generating the build system with CMake, pass the desired day as an option:
   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build -DSPECIFIC_DAY=01
   cmake --build build
   ```
   This builds only the executable for **Day 01**.
   To execute:
   ```bash
   build/01/day01
   ```

2. **Build All Days (Default)**  
   If you don't specify the `SPECIFIC_DAY` option, all challenges will be built:
   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build
   cmake --build build
   ```

---

### **Optional: Cleaner Output**
To make it easier to find executables, you can customize the output directory for each day's build. Add this line to each day's `CMakeLists.txt`:

Example (`01/CMakeLists.txt`):
```cmake
set_target_properties(day01 PROPERTIES RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin/01)
```

Now, executables will be organized under `build/bin/<day_number>/`.

---

### **Testing the Setup**
To verify the setup:
1. **Configure for Day 02**:
   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build -DSPECIFIC_DAY=02
   ```
2. **Build**:
   ```bash
   cmake --build build
   ```
3. **Run the Executable**:
   ```bash
   ./build/02/day02
   ```
